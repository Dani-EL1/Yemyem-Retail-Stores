# Yemyem Supermarket Sales Analysis (2018)

## Project Overview
As a data analyst at Yemyem Supermarket, I was tasked with analyzing the 2018 sales data to provide a comprehensive visualization and actionable insights. The managing director wanted a detailed understanding of the sales trends and customer behaviors as he was unavailable to monitor the performance during that year.

## Key Objectives
The analysis focused on answering the following:
- **Top-Selling Product:** Identify the product sold the most.
- **Most Profitable Product:** Determine the product that generated the highest profit.
- **Peak Sales Time:** Analyze the time of day with the most sales.
- **Peak Sales Day and Month:** Identify the day and month with the highest sales.
- **Customer Preferences:**
  - Login type most used for purchases.
  - Most frequently used payment method.
  - Gender that purchased products the most.

## Insights and Recommendations
The findings from this analysis were used to offer actionable recommendations to improve sales performance and operational efficiency for the supermarket.
